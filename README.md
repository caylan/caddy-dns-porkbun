# caddy-dns-porkbun
Builds a custom [Caddy](https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy) docker image that includes the [Porkbun caddy-dns](https://github.com/caddy-dns/porkbun) module for managing DNS records with Porkbun.

## Note
This is not intended for production use cases, as it always fetches the latest versions of Caddy and the provider module.
